# Data Analyst Bootcamp
This is a basic walkthrough of the data analyst boot camp created by Alex the Analyst on Youtube. 
I would highly recommend checking out his video! It's extremely helpful for beginners. 

For reference, the link to his video is: youtube.com/watch?v=PyYgERKq25I&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=4

The boot camp itself focuses on SQL (Microsoft SQL Server), Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python (Jupyter Notebook/Anaconda).
